## Introduction

The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. This project provides a command-line interface and a graphical user interface to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher.

## Features

- Encrypt messages with a specified shift.
- Decrypt messages with a specified shift.
- Handle both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Preserve non-alphabetic characters in the input.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
- File encryption and decryption.
- Basic cryptanalysis feature to break the cipher.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shradha-2022/PRODIGY_CS_01.git
